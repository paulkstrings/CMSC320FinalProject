# Uncovering Trends and Patterns in NBA Player Statistics
### Fall 2024 Data Science Project
### Paul Kettlestrings
I worked on this project by myself, and thus was the sole contributer for every part of the project.

## Introduction
For this project, I chose to look at NBA statistics. I love watching basketball, and I wanted to see if some assumptions I had about the game would be backed up by the data. I looked at the effect of position and experience on player performance, as well as how a player's minutes impacts their points per game. I also wanted to use the data to make some predictions about the upcoming season, such as who will win the MVP award and the Most Improved Player award.
